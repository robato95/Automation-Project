# Data Entry Automation Project
This was a project to practice using the automation tools provided by the pyautogui and the webbrowser packages.

```bash
import pyautogui as pag
import webbrowser as wb
```
Using these packages I created code that would fill out the following form based on a dictionary I created internally.

I created a dictionary that included the shirt size for each of my family members. I also used the randfacts packge to write a random fact in the comment section of the form.
